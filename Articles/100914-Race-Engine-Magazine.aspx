            <p>Dan Esslinger, President of Esslinger Engineering has been building Midget engines since 1990 - “So I guess we’re 20-ish years into this thing,” he says. In that time, Esslinger Engineering has gone through perhaps 30 iterations of pistons, “That’s been due to bore size change, different strokes, different rod lengths, valve locations, things of that ilk,” he says. “If you change one, it all changes.</p>
		    <p>“Typically we use JE three-ring pistons because they are local (less than an hour away from Esslinger’s shop) and they do an outstanding job. They work with us and turn stuff around in a hurry. We’ve found they make fewer mistakes than we do! Sometimes we ask for things we shouldn’t and they (the pistons) get stuck in engineering that way. JE generally gives us what we ask,” Esslinger says.</p>
		    <p>Because there have been so many different piston designs going through the Esslinger Engineering shops in South El Monte, California, the company has ended up with product on the shelf. This is also due to the different ring packages, “As the ring manufacturers figure out different things that work better for what we’re doing,” Esslinger says.</p>
		    <p>“And some things you try and go straight away from them; some things you stay with. There are different ways of doing gas porting and everything you change changes another three things, it seems. It’s hard to put stuff on the shelf and hang on to it for a very long time when there is so much research and development going on,” he says.</p>
