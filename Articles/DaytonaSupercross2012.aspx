	    HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (March 11, 2012) – The Daytona Supercross is always a unique stop of the Monster Energy AMA Supercross Tour.  The first race was held in 1971, making this the 41st year of supercross racing in the Daytona International Speedway infield.  The Daytona course is more of a hybrid, part motocross and part supercross, and always the toughest track of the season, even in perfect weather.  Enter Mother Nature and the track can rival even the worst outdoor motocross conditions.  Rain pounded the track early in the day delaying practice, and turning the racing surface into a literal quagmire.  SPEED broadcast the entire event live, and FUEL TV will re-air the telecast tonight at 8:00 p.m. (EST).
<br /><br />
Despite the conditions, James Stewart and Davi Millsaps easily transferred directly to the main event from their respective heat races with Stewart winning his eighth heat race of the season. With the track a muddy mess the start was crucial for the main event.  When the gate fell it was Millsaps leading the pack with Stewart in tow.  On lap three of 16 (the normal 20-lap main was shortened due to the conditions) Stewart passed Millsaps and the JGRMX/Toyota/Yamaha Team riders maintained first and second to the checkers.  It was Stewart’s second win of the season and Millsap’s first podium since the 2010 season.
"I felt good all day," said Stewart.  "I was fast in practice and we got a start, those Pirelli tires were awesome out there.  Once I got out front I pulled a lead and just tried to survive, I want to thank everyone at JGRMX, Toyota, Yamaha, Answer, Nike, Red Bull, Oakley, and T-Haynes," added Stewart.  Tony Haynes was a promising African American racer who was paralyzed when James was a child, James took his number 259 to honor his friend promising to take the number to the top, which he has.  He ran the 259 in the first practice as a tribute to Haynes, who lives near the Daytona facility and was on-hand for the event.<br /><br />
"I had a good week riding at my house and it was a good race," said Millsaps on the podium.  "I can’t thank JGRMX/Toyota/Yamaha enough, I also want to thank Ezra (Lusk), my mechanic Ben, my trainer Pablo, my wife, O’neal, Sidi, Oakley, Pirelli, just everyone thanks."<br /><br />



Round 11 of the Monster Energy AMA Supercross Series will be on March 17 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Ind. SPEED will begin live coverage at 7:30 p.m. (EST).  FUEL TV will carry the re-cap from Indianapolis at 8:00 p.m. (EST) on March 18.<br />
