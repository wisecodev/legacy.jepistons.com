		<p>Mooresville, NC (June 20, 2011) Carl Edwards took his Roush Yates powered FR9 to Victory Lane in front of Ford country on Saturday at Michigan International Speedway. With 9 laps to go, Edwards passed Ford teammate Ricky Stenhouse Jr. to win the Alliance Truck Parts 250 and give Roush Fenway Racing three cars finishing in the top five. Edwards, Stenhouse Jr., and Bayne dominated the race, leading a combined 101 of the 125 lap event. Other Roush Yates engine drivers showcasing their power this weekend were Ryan Grubaugh and Chuck Hebing in the Sprint Car series and Josh Richards in the World of Outlaw Late Model series.
<p>"Ricky drove his heart out -- that guy is unbelievable," Edwards said in victory lane. "I didn't think I was going to be able to get him, but it was like his car got tightened up. Man, he did a good job. ... I thought Ricky was setting sail. He's someone I'm a little nervous about in the future."
<p>Stenhouse held on to second place, crossing the finish line 1.669 seconds behind Edwards, and took the lead in the series standings by two points over eighth-place finisher Elliott Sadler.
<p>"We just got too tight there at the end," said Stenhouse. "It was a good one-two finish for Jack and everyone at Roush Yates Engines. This track definitely needs a motor and we have it. This was a great day for Ford, we wanted a one-two-three finish, but three cars in the top-five and one-two is pretty good."
<p>Roush Yates experienced success on the dirt tracks as well this weekend. Ryan Grubaugh won at Cherry Raceway on Friday night in the Engine Pro ASCS Sprints on Dirt series. Grubaugh is currently second in the series points for 2011 and races a Roush Yates Sprint 360 engine. Chuck Hebing won at Lebanon Valley Speedway on Saturday night, earning his first Lucas Oil Empire Super Sprints win of the season.
<p>Josh Richards found Victory Lane in the Ernie Davis Roush Yates powered Ford at Winchester Speedway in the World of Outlaws Late Model Series. This is Richards' 29th career World of Outlaws triumph, breaking his tie with Steve Francis of Ashland, Ky. and becoming the circuit's winningest driver since 2004.</td>
