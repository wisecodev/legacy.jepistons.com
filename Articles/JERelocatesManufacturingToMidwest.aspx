		<p class="NewsText">We are pleased to announce that JE Pistons will be relocating our advanced manufacturing center to a new facility in Mentor, Ohio. The relocation will occur in several stages from July through November 2012 and will involve moving over 75 modern CNC machines and supporting equipment. The decision to relocate is part of an effort to be closer to the majority of our customers, improve delivery, and expand our capabilities. To ensure we continue our industry-leading fill rate and high service level, we will not discontinue any manufacturing capability in Huntington Beach until corresponding capabilities are established in the new facility.</p>
		<p class="NewsText">We realize speed of delivery is critical to our customers. We estimate that over 70% of our U.S. customers will experience reduced delivery time along with a 25% reduction in shipping cost. With results this significant, we couldn't ignore the opportunity. Additionally, manufacturing outside of California will allow JE to offer advanced, cost effective piston coatings.</p>
		<p class="NewsText">JE Pistons will continue to retain a strong presence in Southern California. A modern Technical Center will be established to maintain sales, customer service, engineering and development as they operate today. Rest assured that there will be no disruption in communication, ordering or customer service as a result of equipment relocation.
<p class="NewsText">Please direct any questions to our customer service department at (714) 898-9763 extension 4281. </p>
<p class="NewsText">Thank you,</p>
<p class="NewsText">The JE Pistons Team</p>
