            <p>Corona, Calif. (February 14, 2011) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki's Dean Wilson and Blake Baggett started off the AMA Supercross Lites Eastern Region with podium finishes at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. Wilson battled for the lead and eventually finished second, while Baggett came from 12th to round out the podium in third. 
			<p>Out to prove he can be a championship contender, Wilson started out the day well with fast qualifying times that translated that into a heat race win. In the main event, he got out front early and battled back and forth for the lead, and eventually finished second. 
			<p>"I had a lot of fun racing again," said Wilson. "It's been a while since Pala and I am excited for the season to start. I am not fully 100 percent with my endurance since my injury in December, but I know it won't be long before I'm able to push it for the win. Atlanta should be good and I'm really looking forward to getting back out there."
			<p>In his first year aboard the Pro-Circuit backed Kawasaki KX™250F, Baggett entered the race in Houston more prepared than ever to show he was capable of being on top. Baggett had to use every lap of the 15-lap main event after starting 12th, but made an impressive push to finish on the podium in his first race of the season.
			<p>"I'm not really a fan of the short starts like we had in Houston," said Baggett. "I know my bikes fast and I have been working on my starts. I don't like coming through the pack because it can get pretty intense sometimes, but I did my best to salvage as many points as possible. I'm pretty happy considering I had to come from the back, but next race I really want to be up front."
