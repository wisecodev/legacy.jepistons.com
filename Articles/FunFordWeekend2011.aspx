		<p>(May 16, 2011) - The famous Blue Oval will be getting polished all over the nation as the fan-favorite series, Fun Ford Weekend, returns to motorsports facilities throughout the U.S. in 2011. The large car show, drag race, swap meet, and autocross series, presented by JE Pistons and Roush Yates, will be featured at five motorsports tracks in 2011 and will expand to 10 or more events in 2012.
<p>A group of North American motorsports facility owners led by Texas Motorplex (Ennis, Texas) founder Billy Meyer, worked to bring back the Fun Ford Weekend series because of popular demand. 
<p>"Fans and participants all suffered when Fun Ford Weekend was shut down a few years ago," Meyer said. "Ford vehicle owners are extremely loyal to their brand, and they love big events and racing. We are very excited to work with Ford to bring this series back on-line with great additional support from industry leaders like JE Pistons and Roush Yates."
<p>Many of the events will be single-day Saturday or Sunday only in 2011, and expand to full weekend Saturday and Sunday events in 2012. The first Fun Ford Weekend event this season will be held at Bandimere Speedway (Denver) Sunday, June 26. Other tracks set to host events in 2011 are Virginia Motorsports Park (Petersburg, Va.) Saturday, September 10; Palm Beach International Raceway (Jupiter, Fla.) September 16-18, 2011; Memphis International Raceway (Memphis, Tenn.) Saturday, October 1; and Texas Motorplex on Saturday, October 8.
<p>Sporty Bandimere, General Manager of Bandimere Speedway is very excited to kick off the series under the new leadership of the series parent company FFW1.

<p>"It's an honor to host the first event this season and bring the series back to the fans. We have had successful Ford events at Bandimere in the past, but bringing a Fun Ford Weekend raises the bar significantly. We are just having a one-day, Sunday-only event for the series this year, but already know that we will be planning on a multiple day event in 2012 because it's going to be such a hit."
<p>JE Pistons and Roush Yates are supporting the series as it kicks back into action. Doug Yates, CEO of Roush Yates, said the series will help the companies connect with its customers on many levels.
<p>"Roush Yates and JE Pistons have partnered on a lot of great promotions in the past and we expect the Fun Ford Weekend to provide a great audience of current and future customers," Yates said. "This series will help us promote our website www.roushyatesparts.com as well as our ordering hotline at 877-604-8077, to thousands of Ford enthusiasts seeking the best in custom and new parts, as well as these incredible engines. Our goal is to educate every Fun Ford Weekend participant and fan that they can buy new and used Roush Yates parts the same as professional stock car and drag racing teams do every day." 
<p>Further details about the series can be found on line at www.funfordweekend.com. Information regarding competition drag racing and car show classes will be announced soon.
