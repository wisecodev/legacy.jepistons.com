            <p><img src="/Images/Articles/Powersports/MonsterAMAHeader.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;" width="200" height="99" border="0" alt="">Corona, Calif. - (June 29, 2010) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki’s domination of
            the AMA Motocross Series 250 class continued at Thunder Valley Raceway in
            Lakewood, Colo. Christophe Pourcel gave the team its fourth straight overall win and
            Dean Wilson’s third place result also gave the team its fourth straight double podium.
            Tyla Rattray just missed the podium finishing fourth overall while Jake Weimer was 17th.</p>
            <p>Pourcel was once again the class of the field in qualifying, posting a lap nearly two
            seconds quicker than his nearest competitor. Weimer was third fastest and looked to
            turn his luck around with a good gate pick in the motos. Rattray qualified eighth and
            Wilson qualified 11th.</p>
            <p>In the first moto Pourcel launched out to the holeshot on the long uphill start and never
            looked back as he led wire-to-wire to earn his fifth moto win of the year. Right behind
            him was his teammate Wilson who kept the pressure on while running in second for the
            entire moto. Rattray was sixth after the first lap and slowly made his way into fourth.
            While there wasn’t a lot of passing going on up front, Weimer was putting on a clinic as
            he moved up through the field. After trouble on the first lap, Weimer was 36th and looking
            to salvage a good finish. By the end of the fourth lap he had made 16 passes and was
            sitting in 20th. He wasn’t done though as he continued to move up through the pack
            ending up 10th.</p>
            <p>“Being on the podium is awesome,” said Wilson. “That is where I want to be every week.
            Getting second in the first moto was what I needed to run a relaxed second moto.”</p>
            <p>When the gate dropped for the second moto, there was a familiar cast of lime green
            Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki’s near the front with all four riders in the top seven
            positions at the end of the first lap. Wilson led the way in third with Rattray fourth, and
            Pourcel fifth. On the second lap, Weimer again found trouble and dropped all the way
            back to last in 39th. Pourcel made his way through his teammates by lap five and began
            stalking the leader. He would take the lead on lap 10 with Wilson running third and
            Rattray fourth. Weimer again put in a charge moving up through the back of the pack
            again to finish 24th. During the two motos, Weimer passed an amazing 41 riders.</p>
            <p>“I got a good start in both motos,” said Pourcel. “I always want to feel good on the track
            and when I do, I can make it happen and get the win. It was rough for the races, I think I
            liked the night race here better because the track was very smooth and easy.”</p>
            <p>The team now heads to Red Bud for the traditional Fourth of July event with Pourcel,
            Wilson and Rattray still holding the top three spots in the standings.</p>
