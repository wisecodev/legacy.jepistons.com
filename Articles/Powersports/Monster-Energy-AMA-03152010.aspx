            <p>Corona, Calif. (March 15, 2010) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki continued its streak of AMA Supercross Lites Eastern Region podium <img src="/Images/Articles/Powersports/MonsterAMAHeader.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;" width="200" height="99" border="0" alt="">finishes at the Rogers Centre in Toronto as Christophe Pourcel finished third and Dean Wilson just missed the podium in his adopted country of Canada coming home fourth.</p>
			<p>During the qualifying practice, Pourcel once again set the fastest time, clocking a lap nearly one second better than his closest competitor. Wilson was right in the mix as well as he wound up fourth.</p>
			<p>In the first heat race, Wilson jumped out to the early lead and cruised to his first heat race win of the season. His home fans were excited as his win garnered some of the loudest cheers of the night. In the second heat, Pourcel was in the lead early but a mistake in a rhythm section sent him over the bars. He recovered quickly and moved from 10th back up to fifth to transfer into the main event.</p>
			<p>"The crash was my fault," said Pourcel. "I hit the kicker on the tabletop and went over the bars. I've got some bruises, but I'm not hurt too bad. I didn't get a good gate pick for the main and got an okay start. The track was good and I rode a smart race and still have the points lead." </p>
			<p>In the main event both Pourcel and Wilson ran near the front and even staged a little battle early in the race. Both riders rode smart throughout the 15-lap race and both maintained their positions in the points standings as the series reached its midway point.</p>
			<p>"It was really exciting to race in front of these great Canadian fans," said Wilson. "I'm still learning out there and I feel like I'm getting better and stronger every week. I want to be back up on the podium and I'm going to work hard to make sure I can."</p>
			<p>The team is now getting ready to visit the new Cowboy's Stadium in Dallas, Texas. Not only will it be the first race held in the stadium it may also be the supercross debut of Tyla Rattray who is hoping to come back from a broken shoulder this weekend.</p>
