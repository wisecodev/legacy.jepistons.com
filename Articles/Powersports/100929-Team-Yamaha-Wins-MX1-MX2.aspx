            <p>The final round of the 2010 CMRC Canadian Nationals at Walton Raceway, Ontario saw both Dusty Klatt & Tyler Medaglia presented with the coveted #1 CMRC plates at the end of the day.</p>
            <p>Team Yamaha/Red Bull/Blackfoot/Fox Racing's Dusty Klatt had clinched the MX1 Championship at the penultimate round in Richmond, ON - while Tyler Medaglia had to wait until the final round of the nationals in Walton on Sunday to cement the MX2 Championship. </p>
            <p>Medaglia - who held a 20 point margin over defending MX2 champ Teddy Maier going into Walton - cleared the task with grit and style, convincingly winning the first moto. He then settle for a calculated fifth in the second moto.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Klatt gave it his usual 110% by snaring third place in the first MX1 moto and a win in the second moto, which gave him second overall on the day.</p>
            <p>Although it was a bittersweet season in many regards for Team Yamaha Blackfoot Fox Racing, 2010 still proved to be yet another milestone year: two championship efforts - two championship wins! </p>
