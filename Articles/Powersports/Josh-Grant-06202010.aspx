            <p>GAS CITY , Ind. (June 19, 2010) - Henry Wiles had another one of his strong performances Saturday night in the AMA Pro K&N Filters Grand National Championship presented by Motorcyclesuperstore.com event at Gas City/I-69 Speedway. Wiles led all 25 laps of the main event and scored his second victory of the season and second singles race in a row on his Monster Energy Kawasaki/ Shift Racing/ Dons Kawasaki KXF 450. Jared Mees was runner-up on his Rockysonline/ Rogers Lake Racing Honda, 6-10ths of a second behind Wiles. Joe Kopp scored third on his Latus Harley-Davidson/ Jones Powersports Honda.</p> 
            <p>Wiles jumped out to a solid lead in the initial start and a red-flag restart only to have Mees and Kopp close in at one point. Wiles kept his focus on the restart and his # 1 Monster Energy Kawasaki was never seriously challenged. "It was kind of a cat and mouse game," said Wiles. "
            "It was one of those nights where I experimented with lines during the race," said Wiles, who moved past Mees for third in the standings. "I think that's why those guys pulled up on me a bit, but I had to find out what was the fast way around the track and fortunately it worked."</p>
