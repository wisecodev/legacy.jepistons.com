            <p>HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (July 18, 2010) - Spring Creek Motocross Park in Millville, Minn. was the site for round seven of the 2010 AMA Pro Motocross Championship.  Spring Creek is known for steep elevation changes and the roughest section of sand whoops on the circuit.  The section is so tough it has its own mascot.  Each year for more than a decade a dedicated fan known as the Whoop Monster has donned his costume and cheered on the riders with horns, chainsaws (minus the chains), and signs.  It was the 20th time the gate has fallen at Spring Creek for an AMA Pro Motocross event.</p>
		    <p>In the first moto Josh Grant and Justin Brayton both started in the top-10, with Grant moving into sixth by the end of the opening lap.  Grant quickly moved into fourth, and hounded the third-place rider for a lap before making a spectacular pass literally launching himself into third position.  He then dispatched the second-place rider to move in just behind the leader on lap eight, about the halfway point.  Unfortunately two different lapped riders nearly took Grant out of the race, and in doing so allowed the race leader to gain a comfortable advantage.  Grant would finish second, with Brayton 14th.</p>
		    <p>The start of the second moto would see Josh Grant starting just out of the top-10 with Justin Brayton mired back in 18th.  Grant moved forward breaking into the top-five on lap seven.  Grant would remain in fifth until the white flag lap when he succumbed to the heat, struggling just to stay on the bike.  Determined to finish, Grant gutted out the last lap of the race taking the checkered flag and getting immediate assistance from the Asterisk Mobil Medical doctors.  Grant lost five positions on the last lap as he struggled against the effects of heat stroke setting in but was still able to salvage a top-10 finish (10th).  Brayton was able to advance to 12th by the halfway mark, and remained in 12th position until the finish.  Grant's two - 10 moto finishes earned him sixth overall, while Brayton's 14 - 12 scores awarded him 13th for the day.  Grant moved up one position in series points to fifth.  </p>
