            <p>Corona, Calif. (February 22, 2010) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki's Christophe Pourcel didn't let an injury in January slow him down as he <img src="/Images/Articles/Powersports/MonsterAMAHeader.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;" width="200" height="99" border="0" alt="">returned to action, and the top step of the podium in Indianapolis on Saturday night. The defending AMA Supercross Lites Eastern Region champion started his quest to defend his title in dominating fashion winning both his heat race and the main event. His teammate Dean Wilson made his AMA professional debut and came home a solid sixth on the difficult Indy track.</p>
			<p>In qualifying practice Pourcel led the way continually turning in impressive lap times with Wilson just behind him posting the fifth best time. Both riders were slated for the second heat and Pourcel came out of the first turn near the front. He soon made his way to the lead and didn't look back. With Pourcel leading, Wilson battled to a sixth-place result.</p>
			<p>"I kind of surprised myself on the starting line," said Wilson. "I wasn't really nervous and I thought I probably should be. I did ride a little tight and the track was totally different than anything I've even ridden. I learned a lot of things and I want to move forward to next weekend."</p>
			<p>In the main event Pourcel narrowly missed the holeshot but quickly moved to the front of the field. The French rider led all 15 laps in front of more than 60,000 fans, building a five second margin of victory. Wilson came through the first turn in sixth and rode steady throughout the main to hold that position at the checkered flag.</p>
			<p>"The track was tight," said Pourcel. "I knew I had to get to the lead early so I made my passes on the first lap. From there I just trusted my conditioning and rode strong throughout the race. It is good to start the season with a win."</p>
			<p>The Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki team now heads to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta for Round 2 of the AMA Supercross Lites Eastern Region. Atlanta is notorious for close racing action on its red Georgia clay track surface.</p>
