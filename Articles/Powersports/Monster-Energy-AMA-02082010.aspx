            <p>Corona, Calif. (February 8, 2010) - The rain in San Diego couldn't dampen the spirits of Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki as Jake Weimer won <img src="/Images/Articles/Powersports/MonsterAMAHeader.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;" width="200" height="99" border="0" alt="">his fourth Monster Energy AMA Supercross Lites race of the season building a 26-point advantage in the championship standings. Josh Hansen fought back from an early collision to finish 11th.</p>
			<p>With rain showers threatening all day, practice was shortened to just one 12-minute session. As has been the case all season, the team's riders sat atop the leader board with Weimer setting the fastest lap and Hansen finishing third fastest.</p>
			<p>With both riders lined up in the second heat, Weimer blasted to the holeshot and led wire-to wire while Hansen came out of the first turn mid pack. Hanny quickly moved up to third in the heat. Weimer won his fifth straight heat race of the season and claimed first gate pick for the main event.</p>
			<p>"The track was slippery and muddy," said Weimer. "It seemed to get better from practice to the heat and then from the heat to the main, but it was still tricky all night. San Diego is always a technical track and when you add in the weather, tonight was difficult. It always feels better to bring a trophy back to the truck and I'm glad I got the win."</p>
			<p>In the main event Weimer got a good jump off the gate and took advantage to grab the lead on the first lap. Hansen again got a mid-pack start, and then he collided with Trey Canard's bike sending him to the back of the field.  While Weimer continued to pace the race, Hansen started working his way through the field getting up to 11th by the checkered flag. Weimer led from start-to-finish to earn his fourth main event win in five races. </p>
			<p>"San Diego was a tough race," said Hansen. "It just wasn't my night. I know we can get better results and I'm working to get that first win next week at Anaheim."</p>
			<p>The West Coast riders have one race left before taking a nine-week break. The series heads to Angel Stadium this weekend for the third and final time and once that race is over both Weimer and Hansen will be able to relax until their season picks back up in Seattle on April 24.</p>
