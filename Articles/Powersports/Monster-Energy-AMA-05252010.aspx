			Christophe Pourcel left the 2010 AMA Motocross season opener in Sacramento,
			Calif.  tied for the points lead after finishing second overall with moto
			finishes of 1-3. His teammate Jake Weimer was fourth overall with Dean
			Wilson sixth overall and Tyla Rattray 11th overall.</p>
			
			<p>Pourcel started off on the right foot earning the first gate pick with the
			fastest time in overall qualifying. Weimer was fifth in qualifying, Rattray
			10th and Wilson 11th.</p>
			
			<p>I feel like I rode better than my results show, said Weimer. I've been
			working hard on my outdoor program and I feel really good about it. I need
			to work on my starts so I can get out front early and not have to worry
			about finding a way around the other riders. </p>
			
			<p>In the first moto, both Pourcel and Wilson jumped out to good starts with
			Pourcel taking the lead on the first lap and Wilson holding down the fourth
			spot. Just behind them was Weimer in sixth. Pourcel continued to lead until
			lap 11 when he went down and dropped to third. Over the next five laps, the
			French rider regrouped and moved up to the rear fender of the leader. On the
			final lap, Pourcel pushed hard and was able to take the lead and grab the
			moto 1 victory.  Weimer rode a steady race throughout, moving up to fourth
			early and staying there. Wilson fell on the second lap and dropped form
			fourth to 14th and by checkered flag he worked his way up to 10th.</p>
			
			<p> The track was difficult today, said Pourcel. I was riding well up front
			and then I went down. I wasn't nervous at all; I just did what I needed to
			get back up to the front. The last lap was fun and it was good to make the
			pass. </p>
			
			<p>In the second moto, it was Wilson who was the fastest Pro Circuit rider out
			of the gate sitting in fourth. Pourcel was right behind him in sixth while
			Weimer was 10th and Rattray 18th. The tight track at Hangtown made it
			difficult to pass so each of the riders was focused on moving up as much as
			they could. Wilson moved into third on the sixth lap with Pourcel right on
			his rear fender. The two rode in lock-step until the final lap when Pourcel
			passed Wilson to take third in the moto. Weimer and Rattray finished eighth
			and 16th respectively.</p>
			
			<p> I rode tight during the first moto, said Wilson.  I just didn't know what
			to expect and once I loosened up I was able to find some good lines and stay
			consistent. In the second moto things went a lot better and I stayed loose
			all the way through. </p>
			
			<p>The team now has a weekend off before heading to Freestone County, Texas for the second of 12 AMA Motocross rounds.</p>
