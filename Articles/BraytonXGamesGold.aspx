	  HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (Aug. 4, 2013) – Justin Brayton refused to settle for what would have been his third Silver Medal in Moto X at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Calif.  Instead he rallied after a brief setback and took the Gold Medal in dramatic fashion on the last lap in front of a thrilled crowd and a live worldwide ESPN television audience. <br /><br />

After qualifying fastest, Brayton began his heat race in fourth position.  He quickly moved into third and then second with three laps to go.  He caught and began to pressure the leader, but ran out of time and finished the heat in second.<br /><br />

In the main event Brayton determinedly managed to avoid going down in a first turn melee and was in second behind the rider that won his heat race.  By lap five of 20 Brayton was trying to make the pass for the lead with he and the leader pulling away from the field.  At the halfway point Brayton tried to squeeze by on the tight track only to be aggressively blocked by the leader.  The leader was trying everything he could to keep the persistent Brayton at bay, which allowed the third and fourth places riders to catch the dueling leaders.  On lap 11 Brayton again went for the pass only to be aggressively blocked by the leader resulting in Brayton being briefly run up the track losing two positions.  Brayton regrouped and began to move forward quickly regaining third, and then moving into second on lap 14.  With two to go Brayton was again shadowing the leader, making contact in an attempt to pass in a turn.  On the last lap Brayton repaid the favor to the race leader putting the same move on him that he put on Brayton earlier in the race to take the win and the Gold Medal.<br /><br />

During his interview to the crowd and the ESPN audience Brayton said “I felt like I was better around most of the track but the track was so tight it was hard to make a pass and Josh Hill was riding really good.  Thanks to Joe Gibbs Racing, Toyota, Yamaha, Spencer (mechanic), Bud Man (riding coach) and my fiancé Paige for coming out.  Two Silvers and now Gold, I’m ecstatic, I’m pumped.”  The race can be seen on espn.com via this link: <a href="http://xgames.espn.go.com/video/9536903/justin-brayton-wins-men-moto-x-racing-gold">http://xgames.espn.go.com/video/9536903/justin-brayton-wins-men-moto-x-racing-gold</a><br /><br />
      
Brayton along with his Toyota/Yamaha/JGRMX teammate Josh Grant will return to the Lucas Oil AMA Pro Motocross Championship Series at the Unadilla Sports Valley in New Berlin, NY on Aug. 10.  FUEL TV will broadcast the first motos live at 1:00 p.m. (EST).  The second motos will air live on the NBC Sports Network at 3:00 p.m. (EST).<br /><br />
