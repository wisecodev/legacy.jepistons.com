            <p>Corona, Calif. (February 28, 2011) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki's Dean Wilson earned his first-career AMA Supercross Lites victory at the second stop of the AMA Supercross Lites Eastern Region series at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Ga. The win was the first for Wilson, but for the Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki team it was note-worthy number 200. Teammate Blake Baggett also had a good showing as he finished with his second-consecutive podium finish
			<p>Although Wilson has won professional races before in 2010, an AMA Supercross Lites victory had eluded him until Atlanta. He rode smart and made every lap count as he worked his way from fifth to first on his Pro Circuit-backed Kawasaki KX™250F. 
			<p>"I am so happy to finally get my first win," said Wilson. "I feel like I've been so close and to finally win is amazing. I don't know how else to describe it but as a dream come true. I worked really hard over the past two weeks to get my endurance back to where I was before my injury. It really came through this week since I was able to charge from an okay start."
			<p>Continuing to show his consistency, newest team member Baggett put in another good ride, racing the front-runners and eventually finishing third.
			<p>"A podium finish is always good for the points, but when I come to race, I want to win," said Baggett. "I am motivated more than ever to make sure I am ready for this weekend in Daytona. I know I have the speed, but I just need to put it together and get a win."
			<p>Since developing its race team in 1991, Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki has proven its success year in and year out. In Atlanta, Wilson was able to earn the team its 200th win and there is no intention of stopping there.
			<p>"Everyone always says that getting to 100 wins is a big deal and we didn't pay much attention to it, so we wanted to celebrate this time," said Team Owner Mitch Payton. "We definitely wanted to remember this accomplishment and it feels really special to get number 200."
			<p>The Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki team heads to the historical Daytona Supercross at Daytona International Speedway this weekend as the Monster Energy Supercross, an FIM Championship picks up momentum on the East Coast.
