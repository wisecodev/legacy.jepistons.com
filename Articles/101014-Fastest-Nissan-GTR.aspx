            <p>After months of development and rigorous testing on the dyno and street, the AMS Performance Alpha 10 Nissan GT-R, owned by AMS customer Tim Sanders, made its first track debut a little over a week ago at Great Lakes Dragway in Union Grove, WI. Tim flew in from his hometown in Florida along with friend, Chuck Hannold, of NAGTROC.ORG with the full intention of seeing his Alpha 10 smash the previous GT-R quarter mile record of <span style="color: red;">9.62 @ 150mph</span> and that it did! 
		    <p>The honors of piloting the Alpha 10 GT-R were given to one of the leading builders of R35 GT-R transmissions, John Shepherd of sheptrans.com, who made three passes down the track. The first pass was a ½ pass to make sure the launch was good and that track conditions were ok. Wheel hop in the colder weather was a problem but John was optimistic about its potential times that night. The record was set on the second pass with a <span style="color: red;">9.52 @ 150mph</span>,  and after only a few minutes of celebration and deliberation by Sanders, Shepherd and the AMS team, the decision was made to run the GT-R one more time for an even better time. The third and last pass shaved almost two-tenths of a second off the last pass bringing the new world record down to <span style="color: red;">9.33 @ 153mph</span>!
		    <p>JE Pistons is proud to congratulate AMS Performance on this great achievement!
