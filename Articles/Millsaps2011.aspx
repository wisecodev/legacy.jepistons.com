	    <p>HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (Feb. 20, 2011) - San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium was host to round seven of the AMA Supercross Championship.  Supercross is by nature fraught with uncertainty, but when Mother Nature intervenes it becomes even more challenging.  Despite the rain that was falling off and on during the day, 53,342 eager fans with umbrellas and rain coats braved the conditions to watch the event first-hand.   
		<p>The event schedule was adjusted due to the rain, with practice being delayed and time on the track minimized in an attempt to preserve the racing surface.  Justin Brayton and Davi Millsaps were fortunate to transfer to the main event from their heat races without incident, even with the sloppy track.  When the 20-lap main began Brayton found himself in ninth position with Millsaps 15th.  Dealing with both the mud on the track, as well as the spray being flung up by the riders in front of them, the two attempted to advance through the field.  At this point the rain was falling heavily. Brayton fell victim to the mud on the second lap with Millsaps also briefly going down.  Once again the duo began a charge.  Millsaps, who earned his first top-five of the season last week in Houston rallied up to fifth to claim his second consecutive top-five finish of the season with a fifth place overall.  Brayton worked his way from the back of the pack to a hard fought 10th place.
		<p>Recently, in conjunction with Toyota, Coy Gibbs, Justin, Davi, and Joe Gibbs Racing Sprint Cup driver Joey Logano had some fun with specially equipped Toyota Yaris race cars on a road course.  Two fun videos of the event are available via the following links:

		<p>The original broadcast from San Diego was live on SPEED.  The next round of the AMA Supercross Championship Series will be Feb. 26 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Ga.  SPEED will air the original broadcast from Atlanta live at 7:30 p.m. (EST).
