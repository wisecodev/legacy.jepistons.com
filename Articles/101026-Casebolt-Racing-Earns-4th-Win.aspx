            <p>RICHMOND, IN (October 21st, 2010) - Casebolt Racing used a rare home-state appearance to capture their 4th win of the season at the Kokomo Klash in Kokomo, IN. Kokomo Speedway is just two hours from the team's race shop but this was only the 2nd time Steve had raced there. The first time was earlier this season where the team picked up a 5th place finish in the Summernationals event.</p>
		    <p>This win also marked the first win for Casebolt Racing with their new Mastersbilt Chassis. Steve has been in a Rocket Chassis since 2002. This is the first time he has ventured to try any other chassis manufacture since then. "I really like the way the Mastersbilt feels for me. It is still going to take some getting used to and it will take a little time to learn which adjustments to make though", said Steve.</p>
		    <p>Steve began the evening by qualifying fastest in his heat race group. The team thought they may have a hard time in the heat after being inverted to the 4th position and having one of the tougher heat races, but Steve was in the lead by the end of lap 1. "The preferred groove was at the top of the track and I knew that, but for some reason those guys on the front row ran the middle and let me sneak around them on the top."</p>
		    <p>Winning the second heat race put Steve on the front row outside for the feature. In a race that went green to checkered with no cautions Steve lead every lap and secured the win for the Dixie Chopper Lawn Mowers sponsored team. With no cautions Steve completed the entire 25 lap race in just over 7 minutes. Steve and team earned $2010 for their efforts. Kokomo is a quarter mile oval that is predominately raced on by sprint cars.</p>
		    <p>There are two more races left on the Casebolt Racing schedule. Steve and team will travel to Florence Speedway in Union, KY this weekend. On October 30th Steve will compete at KC Raceway for what will probably be the team's final event of the season.</p>
