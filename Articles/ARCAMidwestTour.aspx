			<p><b>March 17, 2016</b> –  Officials from the ARCA Midwest Tour and JE Pistons have developed a long-term short track agreement which benefits both the ARCA Midwest Touring Stars as well as the local and weekly drivers throughout the region.  Additionally, JE Pistons has been named as the presenting sponsor of the Dick Trickle 99 Super Late Model event during the Oktoberfest Race Weekend at LaCrosse Fairgrounds Speedway.  </p>
			<p>At each ARCA Midwest Tour event, the top local competitor using JE Pistons will be awarded a $50 Cash Bonus for their efforts.  Likewise, a set of JE Pistons will be awarded to the Championship Engine Builder during the season ending Champion’s Banquet.</p>
             <p>“JE Pistons is proud to partner with the ARCA Midwest Tour as the series’ Official Piston,” said Sean Crawford, Director of Marketing, JE Pistons. “The ARCA Midwest Tour is one of the nation’s foremost super late model series and will serve as an outstanding vehicle for JE Pistons to expand its involvement in the Midwest. Our Mentor, Ohio manufacturing facility is conveniently located in the heart of the Midwest and can deliver any of the thousands of pistons we have in stock in just one day. The Midwest has a rich and storied racing tradition. This is an opportunity that makes great business sense for JE and we’re excited to support some of the very best pavement late model racing the country has to offer.”</p>
            <p>The Dick Trickle 99 has become a premier event within a larger event, as an average of more than 66 drivers have attempted to win the popular three segment race over the past five seasons.  The JE Pistons involvement at Oktoberfest will reach far past the Dick Trickle 99 however.  Not only will the winner of each segment of the Dick Trickle 99 presented by JE Pistons receive a JE award for their efforts, feature winners in each class competing during Oktoberfest Race Weekend will be rewarded for their accomplishments.</p>
            <p>For nearly 70 years, JE Pistons is the leader in high-performance forged pistons with a reputation that the competition can only follow. JE manufacturers the highest quality pistons and components that professional engine builders, race teams, and high-performance enthusiasts trust and rely on</p>
 <p>The ARCA Midwest Tour kicks off its 2016 Championship point season May 1st at Madison International Speedway for the Annual Joe Shear Classic. Many of the Touring Stars will see action on Saturday April 16 at Toledo Speedway for a non-points event held in conjunction with the ARCA CRA Super Series presented by Jeg’s</p>
