		<p>San Luis Obispo, CA, February 7, 2010 - The Canidae Racing Team, in their newly redesigned 2011 Trophy Truck, was able to turn in a hard-fought finish in the 2011 Parker 425 Best in the Desert race in Arizona this past weekend.
		<p>The race began Saturday with a total of three 142-mile laps across the treacherous Arizona desert. More than 30 teams competed in the elite Trick Truck (aka Trophy Truck) class, with only a portion of those teams making it across the finish line.
		<p>While the team's newly installed 800 HP 454 CI Dougan small block Chevy performed flawlessly, the truck flew into a canyon and sustained some damage. After having been pulled out by the generous crew of the TSCO truck, team Canidae went to work and got the Trophy Truck back to racing condition in record time and was able to complete the race.
		<p>The entire crew at Canidae Racing would like to extend a special welcome to their newest sponsor, JE Pistons. "Here at Canidae Racing we know our pistons and only use JE. Whether it's in our fuel car, our Trophy Truck or our street rods, JE Pistons has what we need when we need it. With over 70 years of experience, they are the leader in high performance forged pistons," said Scott Gailey, team manager for Canidae Racing. Visit JE Pistons at http://www.jepistons.com/.
		<p>Next up for Team Canidae is the famous SNORE Mint 400 March 26th and 27th. The crew will have to thrash to get the truck to mint condition, but with the help of Geiser Bros and the awesome Canidae crew it will be possible. Last year at the Mint was the team's best performance with a Trick Truck 7th place finish. The team is looking forward in trying to better last year's awesome finish.
		<p>Canidae Racing would not be able to compete at this level if not for the support of their sponsors including Canidae Pet Foods, Lucas Oil, BFGoodrich Tires, Magnaflow, KC HiLites, Torco Race Fuels, Tap It Brewing Co., JE Pistons, Fox Race Shox, Geiser Bros., K&N Air Filters, Racepak Data Systems, CalTex Freight, McKenzies, Specialty Fasteners, XRP Hoses and Fittings, Norco Tires, and RSP Shock Prep.
