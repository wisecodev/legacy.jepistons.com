    		<p>JE driver Peter Biondo continues his sizzlin' summer hot streak with a dominating performance at arguably one of the biggest and toughest bracket races of the year.   The pits at Atco Raceway were swarmed with over 200 of the most talented drivers in the country all coming for a shot at three days of racing and $25,000 to win each day.  As day one came to an end, Biondo came up only one round short of taking it all.  "It was bittersweet; I was happy to make it to the final round with such a talented field of racers but in the final, when the win light comes on in the other lane, that tends to sting a bit" said Peter.  Despite losing the final, Peter ended up with $12,000 for his efforts and 2 more days of action to try to turn his final round performance into a win.  After falling in the early rounds on day 2 of the event, Biondo 'one upped' is Friday performance by taking home the big $25,000 check on Sunday.  "Without a doubt, the biggest win of the year for me.  My dragster is equipped with JE Pistons and was within thousandths of a second all day long.  No doubt this played a big role in the win" said Peter.  No doubt a weekend for the record books for the versatile driver most refer to as 'The Terminator'.</p>
