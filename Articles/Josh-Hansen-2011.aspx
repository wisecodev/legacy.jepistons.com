            <p>Corona, Calif. (February 7, 2011) - Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki's Josh Hansen earned his second win at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Calif. as he raced through the pain of a broken finger. With the win, he extended his points lead over teammate Broc Tickle, who finished just off the podium in fourth. Tyla Rattray took the night off after a crash during the week injured his back.
			<p>After clocking in the fastest qualifying time of the day, Hansen crashed in the whoops section, injuring his pinky finger. With the championship on the line, he tried to put the pain out of his mind and captured his third win of the season.
			<p>“I kept telling myself that I would only be in pain for 15 minutes,” said Hansen. “I didn’t want to let a small injury pull me out of going after the championship. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but I’m glad I did it.”
			<p>Coming off a win in Oakland, Tickle continued to show he has the speed to be on top of the podium. He got a good start and battled on the tough track, nearly passing for third on the last lap.
			<p>“I really wanted to be on the podium this week,” said Tickle. “I know that coming so close like I did will only motivate me for the next race. The track was limited for passing and no one made a big enough mistake to capitalize on. I’ll be focused and ready to go after another win in San Diego.”
			<p>Rattray was unable to race in Anaheim after injuring his back while practicing during the week. He decided not to race and will use the week break to recover.
			<p>“It is hard sitting out because I’ve really enjoyed racing supercross,” said Rattray. “I know it’s my first year, but I felt like I’ve been doing well. I’ve just had to work through injury all year. I don’t know if I’m racing San Diego, but if I can’t, I’ll be looking for my first win in Seattle.”
			<p>Going into a one-week break for the western region riders, Hansen continues to lead the standings with 113 points, followed by teammate Tickle in second with 108 points, and Rattray in ninth with 58 points. The Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki eastern region riders Dean Wilson and Blake Baggett will make their season debut this week in Houston, Texas at the sixth stop of the Monster Energy Supercross, an FIM Championship.
