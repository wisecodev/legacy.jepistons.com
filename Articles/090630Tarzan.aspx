		    <p>Racing under the bright sun in 85 degree temperatures and oppressive 100 percent humidity on Saturday, Tarzan logged the quickest time of the day with a 1:28.3 after the three practice sessions during his first time at this track, while AMS heated up the competition with a 1:28.6. During the debrief, Tarzan was optimistic about the time he could shave on new tires come Sunday so the team decided to turn up the boost with the hopes of an overall win.</p>
		    <p>Dark rain clouds loomed on the Sunday morning practice runs as Tarzan pulled in a 1:29.7 on Saturday's used tires while AMS ran a 1:27.6, the weekend's fastest time at that point. With a new set of tires and a couple more pounds of boost, Tarzan performed beyond expectations in the first Time Attack session clocking a 1:27.3, firmly placing Crawford Performance in first place.</p>
		    <p>With rain imminent, the Redline Time Attack officials canceled all afternoon practice sessions and rescheduled the second Time Attack session two hours earlier. With another quick tire change and a splash of fuel, Tarzan finished the second TA competition with a blistering 1:26.735, enough to hold off mounting pressure from powerhouse AMS and set the TA track record for the Autobahn Country Clubs south track. </p>
		    <p>In head-to-head competition during Redlines new 'Super Session', while fighting light rain and the top racing teams, Tarzan pulled out a decent lead on the field of competitors for a commanding first-place finish. His performance on both days locked up four first-place finishes between the Super Session, Unlimited AWD, Unlimited Class Champion and the Overall Champion. To top it off, Tarzan also set the Redline TA track record.</p>
		    <p>Tarzan Yamada continues to impress on the Time Attack circuit, his win in Illinois is his third of the season and second track record. He was crowned AWD champion at the Redline Time Attack season opener at Buttonwillow Raceway in California, and took another overall win / track record at Firebird International Raceway in Phoenix during the Super Lap Battle qualifier. This weekends results puts Crawford firmly in the points lead for the 2009 Redline TA season.</p>
