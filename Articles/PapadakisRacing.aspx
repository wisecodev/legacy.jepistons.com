Fredric Aasbo repeats as “Fan Favorite” 
</span><br /><br />
	    IRWINDALE, Calif., (October 14, 2013) – Hankook Tire Scion Racing driver Fredric Aasbo again received the “Fan Favorite” honor this weekend as Formula Drift celebrated the conclusion of an exciting 10th anniversary season.
<br /><br />
       It is Aasbo’s second-straight “Fan Favorite” nod. He also won the fan-voted award in 2012. 
<br /><br />
In front of a sold-out crowd at Irwindale Speedway Saturday, the driver continued his unmatched Top-Eight streak to finish the season among the top-five in the championship rankings. 
<br /><br />
“We’ve proven we know how to beat every driver out there and we have a lot of good momentum to carry into 2014,” said Aasbo after Saturday’s competition.
<br /><br />
Aasbo showed remarkable consistency all year long in his Papadakis Racing Scion tC, on Saturday becoming the only driver to advance to or past the round of eight in eliminations at every single 2013 event. The driver also achieved one top qualifying position and placed among the top-three qualifiers at four of the seven rounds this year. 

<br /><br />
“To win championships, you have to be in the game every single round of competition,” said team owner Stephan Papadakis, whose Papadakis Racing squad has previously scored two Formula Drift titles with driver Tanner Foust. “No other team has had shown such consistency, and that’s the key to winning championships.”

<br /><br />
The team, which runs the Hankook Tire Ventus RS-3 in competition, is proud that their achievement contributed to Hankook’s tire championship win.  
<br /><br />
“The Hankook Tire Ventus RS-3 tires we run are critical to our success,” said Papadakis. “To get nearly 800-horsepower to the ground requires a great tire and Hankook provides just that. We owe a good deal of our performance this season to our Hankook tires.”

<br /><br />
The Hankook Tire Scion Racing tC produces more than 700 horsepower from its nitrous-boosted turbocharged, four-cylinder engine. It’s an increasingly popular set-up in a field once dominated by big-muscle V8 power. The team has proven the platform’s competence and intends to continue the vehicle’s development into 2014

<br /><br />
“It’s a different direction from some of the other cars out there on the grid, many of which use V8 engine swaps,” said Papadakis. “But we are confident in the performance we can get from a Scion tC.”

<br /><br />
In addition to the fourth-place championship result and the fan-voted “Fan Favorite Driver of the Year” award, the team also earned the “Crew Members of the Year” -- an achievement recognizing the work of Shawn Hillier and Aldo Villagran, and selected by their peers in the paddock.

<br /><br />
Drifting is a high-skill, high-powered motorsport with an emphasis on car control skill. Drivers compete in knockout heats on a closed course, sliding sideways in trials judged on speed and style. With origins in Japan, it is the fastest growing form of motorsport in the world.

                    Fredric Aasbo is expected to return to Papadakis Racing to contest his fourth Formula Drift season in 2014. The Norwegian driver, twice voted “Fan Favorite of the Year” (2012, 2013), is a two-time Nordic Drifting champion (2007, 2008) and 2010 Formula Drift Rookie of the Year. He ran select Formula Drift events in 2009 and 2010 and made his U.S. debut at a global drifting invitational in 2008. He has rapidly progressed through the drifting ranks around the world and has established himself as both a fan favorite and proven championship contender.
                    <br /><br />
                    Originally from Ski, Norway, Aasbo splits his time between his native country and Redondo Beach, California. He campaigns a full international season, in 2013 running the full Formula Drift schedule as well as select events worldwide in Europe and in China.

                    Team owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport-compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel-drive, tube-chassis drag car in the U.S.
                    <br /><br />
                    The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear-wheel drive when he campaigned a Civic that became only the fifth car to join the NHRA’s Sport Compact 200 MPH club.
                    <br /><br />
                    Aasbo is the newest member of Papadakis Racing, who signed the Norwegian driver when Tanner Foust announced his retirement from the sport after the 2010 season. The team began drifting in 2005 and has shown impressive results in seven years of Formula Drift competition, earning two championship titles (2007, 2008). The team finished in the runner-up position in the 2010 championship. The Hankook Tire Scion Racing tC is the team's latest competition build.
