								JE Pistons guarantees your custom pistons will ship in 15 business days or less or you will receive $100 off any future custom piston order of 4 or more pistons. The delivery period begins the day the JE Representative receives 100% of the information required to process the custom order and ends the day the product is shipped. JE is not responsible for delays by shipping carriers. This guarantee does not apply to orders with special order items, coatings, 3D milling operations (3D undercrown or ultracrown), billets, offset lathe dish or require a custom built cylinder head profile as these features add additional days. Please contact your JE Representative for an exact lead time quotation at the time of order.
